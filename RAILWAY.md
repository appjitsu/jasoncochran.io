# Railway Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

- [Railway account](https://railway.app)
- [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli) (optional)
- Resend account with API key

## Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard under "Variables":

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=contact@yourdomain.com
RESEND_TO_EMAIL=jlcochran2013@gmail.com
```

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Railway**
   - Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository
   - Railway will auto-detect Next.js and configure build settings

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Click on your service
   - Go to "Variables" tab
   - Add the environment variables listed above

4. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically deploy on every push to main
   - Access your app at the generated Railway URL

### Method 2: Deploy with Railway CLI

1. **Install Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login**
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Initialize Project**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   railway init
   ```

4. **Add Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   railway variables set RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   railway variables set RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=contact@yourdomain.com
   railway variables set RESEND_TO_EMAIL=jlcochran2013@gmail.com
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

## Build Configuration

Railway auto-detects Next.js. Default settings:

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`
- **Root Directory**: `apps/web`

If needed, customize in `railway.json` or railway.toml.

## Custom Domain

1. **Add Domain in Railway**
   - Go to your service
   - Click "Settings" > "Domains"
   - Click "Custom Domain"
   - Enter your domain (e.g., jasoncochran.com)

2. **Update DNS**
   - Add CNAME record pointing to Railway's provided domain
   - Or use Railway's nameservers

3. **Update Metadata**
   - Update `metadataBase` in `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`
   - Update URLs in `apps/web/app/sitemap.ts`

## Resend Configuration

1. **Get API Key**
   - Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys)
   - Create new API key
   - Copy and add to Railway environment variables

2. **Verify Domain** (for production)
   - Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
   - Add your domain
   - Add DNS records as instructed
   - Update `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` to use your verified domain

## Health Check

Railway will automatically check if your app is healthy by hitting the root URL.

You can customize health checks in Railway settings if needed.

## Monitoring

- **Logs**: View in Railway dashboard under "Deployments" > "View Logs"
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Network usage in Railway dashboard
- **Alerts**: Configure in Railway settings

## Continuous Deployment

Railway automatically deploys when you push to your main branch.

To disable auto-deploy:
- Go to service settings
- Disable "Auto Deploy"

## Rollbacks

If a deployment fails:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click on a previous successful deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"

## Environment-Specific Variables

For staging/production environments:

1. Create separate Railway services for each environment
2. Use different environment variables for each
3. Deploy different branches (e.g., `develop` for staging, `main` for production)

## Troubleshooting

**Build Failures:**
- Check logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Ensure Node version compatibility (Railway uses Node 18+ by default)

**Contact Form Not Working:**
- Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
- Verify `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` domain is verified in Resend

**Styles Not Loading:**
- Check build logs for Tailwind CSS errors
- Verify postcss.config.mjs is present
- Clear Railway cache and redeploy

## Cost Optimization

- Railway offers $5/month free credit
- Optimize images and assets
- Consider adding caching headers
- Use Railway's built-in CDN

## Security

- Never commit `.env` file
- Use Railway's environment variables for secrets
- Enable HTTPS (automatic with Railway)
- Keep dependencies updated
