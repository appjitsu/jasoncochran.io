Building the Rook PSA platform as a multi-tenant SaaS application was one of our biggest architectural challenges. With hundreds of enterprise clients, each with sensitive financial and operational data, we couldn't afford a single security mistake. Over three years of running in production, our multi-tenant architecture has proven secure, scalable, and maintainable.

Here's everything we learned about building multi-tenant SaaS applications the right way.

## What is Multi-Tenancy?

Multi-tenancy means running a single application instance that serves multiple customers (tenants), while keeping each tenant's data completely isolated. It's the foundation of modern SaaS.

The alternative approaches are:

- **Single-tenant**: Each customer gets their own application instance and database
- **Multi-instance**: Shared application code but separate databases per customer
- **Multi-tenant**: Shared application and database with logical data isolation

We chose multi-tenancy because it offers:

- Lower infrastructure costs (one database vs. hundreds)
- Easier maintenance (one codebase to update)
- Simpler deployment (one application to deploy)
- Better resource utilization (shared compute)

But it requires solving hard problems: data isolation, security, and performance at scale.

## Multi-Tenancy Models: Choosing the Right Approach

There are three main multi-tenancy models for databases:

### 1. Separate Database Per Tenant

Each tenant gets their own database. Maximum isolation but expensive and hard to manage at scale.

```
tenant_1_db
tenant_2_db
tenant_3_db
...
```

We ruled this out because managing hundreds of databases would be operational nightmare. Schema migrations alone would take hours.

### 2. Separate Schema Per Tenant

One database, but each tenant gets their own schema (namespace).

```
Database: rook_psa
  - tenant_1 schema
  - tenant_2 schema
  - tenant_3 schema
```

Better than separate databases, but still creates hundreds of schemas. PostgreSQL can handle this, but query planning and connection pooling become complex.

### 3. Shared Schema with Tenant ID Column

All tenants share the same tables, with a `tenant_id` column on every table for isolation.

```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  -- other columns
);
```

This is what we chose. It's the most scalable approach and simplest to manage, but requires discipline to prevent data leakage.

## Implementing Row-Level Security

Our first line of defense was PostgreSQL's Row-Level Security (RLS). RLS enforces tenant isolation at the database level, so even a buggy query can't leak data across tenants.

### Setting Up RLS

```sql
-- Enable RLS on the table
ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy to only show rows for current tenant
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON projects
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::uuid);

-- Policy applies to all operations
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy_all ON projects
  FOR ALL
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::uuid)
  WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::uuid);
```

Before executing any queries, we set the current tenant:

```typescript
export class TenantContextInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const tenantId = request.user.tenantId;

    // Set PostgreSQL session variable
    return from(this.setTenantContext(tenantId)).pipe(
      mergeMap(() => next.handle())
    );
  }

  private async setTenantContext(tenantId: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.db.execute(
      sql`SET LOCAL app.current_tenant_id = ${tenantId}`
    );
  }
}
```

Now every query automatically filters by tenant ID. Even if we write:

```typescript
const projects = await this.db.select().from(projects);
```

PostgreSQL RLS ensures we only get the current tenant's projects. This is defense in depth—even bugs can't leak data.

### Performance Considerations with RLS

RLS has a cost—PostgreSQL has to apply the policy on every query. We addressed this with:

1. **Indexes on tenant_id**: Every table has an index on `(tenant_id, id)`

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_tenant ON projects(tenant_id, id);
```

2. **Partition tables by tenant_id** for huge tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE time_entries (
  id UUID,
  tenant_id UUID,
  -- other columns
) PARTITION BY HASH (tenant_id);
```

3. **Connection pooling per tenant** for large customers:

```typescript
export class TenantAwareConnectionPool {
  private pools: Map<string, Pool> = new Map();

  getConnection(tenantId: string): Pool {
    if (this.isLargeTenant(tenantId)) {
      // Dedicated pool for large tenants
      return this.getOrCreatePool(tenantId);
    }
    // Shared pool for small tenants
    return this.getSharedPool();
  }
}
```

## Application-Level Tenant Isolation

RLS is our safety net, but we also enforce tenant isolation in application code for performance and clarity.

### Tenant-Scoped Repositories

Every repository automatically scopes queries to the current tenant:

```typescript
export class ProjectRepository {
  constructor(
    private readonly db: DrizzleService,
    private readonly tenantContext: TenantContext
  ) {}

  async findById(id: string): Promise<Project | null> {
    const result = await this.db
      .select()
      .from(projects)
      .where(
        and(
          eq(projects.id, id),
          eq(projects.tenantId, this.tenantContext.currentTenantId)
        )
      )
      .limit(1);

    return result[0] ? this.toDomain(result[0]) : null;
  }

  async save(project: Project): Promise<void> {
    // Ensure tenant ID is set
    const data = {
      ...this.toPersistence(project),
      tenantId: this.tenantContext.currentTenantId,
    };

    await this.db
      .insert(projects)
      .values(data)
      .onConflictDoUpdate({
        target: [projects.id],
        set: data,
      });
  }
}
```

Notice how `tenantId` is always included in queries and set on inserts. This is redundant with RLS, but makes our code explicit and prevents performance penalties from RLS policy checks.

### Tenant Context from JWT

We extract tenant ID from authenticated user's JWT token:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class JwtStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  validate(payload: JwtPayload): AuthenticatedUser {
    return {
      userId: payload.sub,
      tenantId: payload.tenantId,
      email: payload.email,
      roles: payload.roles,
    };
  }
}
```

Every request carries tenant context. We never trust client-provided tenant IDs—always from the authenticated token.

## Preventing Cross-Tenant Data Leakage

Even with RLS and scoped repositories, we added additional safeguards:

### 1. Foreign Key Validation

When creating relationships across entities, validate tenant consistency:

```typescript
export class AssignConsultantToProjectUseCase {
  async execute(projectId: string, consultantId: string): Promise<void> {
    const project = await this.projectRepository.findById(projectId);
    const consultant = await this.consultantRepository.findById(consultantId);

    // This check is critical!
    if (project.tenantId !== consultant.tenantId) {
      throw new TenantMismatchError(
        'Cannot assign consultant from different tenant'
      );
    }

    await this.assignmentRepository.create(projectId, consultantId);
  }
}
```

### 2. Audit Logging

We log every cross-tenant attempt (which should never happen):

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class TenantSecurityAuditor {
  logCrossTenantAttempt(
    userId: string,
    userTenantId: string,
    attemptedTenantId: string,
    resource: string
  ): void {
    this.logger.error('SECURITY: Cross-tenant access attempt', {
      userId,
      userTenantId,
      attemptedTenantId,
      resource,
      timestamp: new Date(),
    });

    // Trigger security alert
    this.alertingService.sendSecurityAlert({
      severity: 'HIGH',
      type: 'CROSS_TENANT_ACCESS_ATTEMPT',
      details: { userId, resource },
    });
  }
}
```

### 3. Integration Tests

We wrote extensive tests to ensure tenant isolation:

```typescript
describe('Tenant Isolation', () => {
  it('should not allow access to another tenant projects', async () => {
    const tenant1Token = await createAuthToken({ tenantId: 'tenant-1' });
    const tenant2Token = await createAuthToken({ tenantId: 'tenant-2' });

    // Create project as tenant 1
    const project = await request(app)
      .post('/projects')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${tenant1Token}`)
      .send({ name: 'Tenant 1 Project' });

    // Try to access as tenant 2
    const response = await request(app)
      .get(`/projects/${project.body.id}`)
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${tenant2Token}`);

    expect(response.status).toBe(404); // Not found, not 403
  });
});
```

We return 404, not 403, to avoid leaking that the resource exists.

## Managing Shared Resources

Some resources need to be shared across tenants (like system users, feature flags, or lookup tables).

### Approach 1: No tenant_id Column

For truly global data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE system_feature_flags (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  feature_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
  -- No tenant_id
);

-- Disable RLS for system tables
ALTER TABLE system_feature_flags DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Approach 2: NULL tenant_id for Shared Data

For data that can be shared or tenant-specific:

```sql
CREATE TABLE industry_codes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID, -- NULL for shared codes
  code VARCHAR(50),
  description TEXT
);

CREATE POLICY industry_codes_policy ON industry_codes
  USING (tenant_id IS NULL OR tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::uuid);
```

This lets tenants see both shared industry codes and their custom ones.

## Handling Schema Migrations

With shared schemas, migrations affect all tenants simultaneously. We developed a safe migration process:

### 1. Backward-Compatible Changes Only

```sql
-- ✅ Safe: Adding nullable column
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN archived_at TIMESTAMP NULL;

-- ❌ Unsafe: Adding non-nullable column
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;

-- ✅ Safe version:
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR(50) NULL DEFAULT 'active';
-- Then deploy code that sets status
-- Then make column non-nullable in next migration
```

### 2. Blue-Green Deployments

We run two application versions during migrations:

1. Deploy new code (compatible with old schema)
2. Run migration
3. Shift traffic to new code
4. Shutdown old code

### 3. Data Migrations in Batches

For large data migrations, we process by tenant:

```typescript
async function migrateProjectStatuses() {
  const tenants = await db.select().from(tenants);

  for (const tenant of tenants) {
    await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
      await tx
        .update(projects)
        .set({ status: 'active' })
        .where(
          and(
            eq(projects.tenantId, tenant.id),
            isNull(projects.status)
          )
        );
    });

    console.log(`Migrated tenant ${tenant.id}`);
  }
}
```

This prevents long-running transactions that lock all tenants.

## Performance at Scale

With 300+ tenants and millions of rows, performance required careful optimization:

### 1. Tenant-Aware Indexing

Every query filters by `tenant_id`, so it's the first column in composite indexes:

```sql
-- Good
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_tenant_status ON projects(tenant_id, status);

-- Bad
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_status_tenant ON projects(status, tenant_id);
```

### 2. Tenant-Based Sharding for Large Customers

Our largest customers got dedicated database instances:

```typescript
export class TenantRouter {
  getDatabaseConnection(tenantId: string): DatabaseConnection {
    const tenant = this.getTenant(tenantId);

    if (tenant.dedicatedDatabase) {
      return this.getDedicatedConnection(tenant.databaseUrl);
    }

    return this.getSharedConnection();
  }
}
```

### 3. Caching with Tenant Isolation

Cache keys include tenant ID:

```typescript
const cacheKey = `tenant:${tenantId}:project:${projectId}`;
const cached = await this.redis.get(cacheKey);
```

This prevents cross-tenant cache pollution.

## Lessons Learned

1. **RLS is essential**: It saved us from several bugs that could have been security incidents
2. **Make tenant_id explicit**: Include it in every query for performance and clarity
3. **Test tenant isolation religiously**: It's too important to trust
4. **Start with shared schema**: You can always shard later if needed
5. **Monitor per-tenant metrics**: Detect noisy neighbors and performance issues early

## Conclusion

Building multi-tenant SaaS is complex, but with the right architecture, it's secure and scalable. Row-Level Security, tenant-scoped repositories, explicit tenant validation, and comprehensive testing gave us confidence serving hundreds of enterprise clients from a single application instance.

After 25 years of building applications, I can say that multi-tenancy done right is the most cost-effective way to deliver SaaS at scale. The key is paranoia about data isolation and defense in depth at every layer.
