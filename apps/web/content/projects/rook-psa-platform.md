# Rook PSA Platform

## Overview

Rook is a comprehensive Professional Services Automation (PSA) platform designed to streamline project management, resource allocation, time tracking, and financial management for professional services organizations. This enterprise-grade SaaS application represents a modern approach to PSA software, built with scalability, maintainability, and user experience as core priorities.

## Project Scale

- **Lines of Code**: 320,000+
- **Architecture Patterns**: 61 identified patterns
- **Development Period**: 2023-2024
- **Team Size**: 5-8 developers

## Technical Architecture

### Hexagonal Architecture

The platform is built using Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters pattern), which provides exceptional separation of concerns and makes the codebase highly testable and maintainable. This architectural approach allows us to:

- Isolate business logic from external dependencies
- Easily swap out infrastructure components
- Write comprehensive unit tests without external dependencies
- Maintain clear boundaries between different layers of the application

### CQRS Pattern

We implemented Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) to optimize read and write operations separately. This pattern enables:

- **Write Side**: Handles commands that modify state, ensuring data consistency and business rule enforcement
- **Read Side**: Optimized queries for reporting and data display
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of read and write operations
- **Performance**: Tailored data models for different use cases

### Domain-Driven Design

The application follows DDD principles with well-defined bounded contexts:

- **Project Management Context**: Handles project lifecycle, milestones, and deliverables
- **Resource Management Context**: Manages team allocation and capacity planning
- **Time Tracking Context**: Captures and processes time entries
- **Financial Context**: Handles billing, invoicing, and revenue recognition
- **Client Management Context**: Manages client relationships and contracts

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

Built from the ground up as a multi-tenant SaaS platform with:

- **Data Isolation**: Complete separation of tenant data at the database level
- **Tenant Context**: Automatic tenant resolution from authentication token
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Efficient resource utilization across tenants
- **Customization**: Per-tenant configuration and feature flags

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **NestJS**: Enterprise-grade Node.js framework providing excellent structure and TypeScript support
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing throughout the application
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable, performant relational database
- **Prisma**: Type-safe database client with excellent migration support
- **Drizzle ORM**: Additional ORM used for complex queries and performance optimization

### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based UI development
- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **TypeScript**: Type safety on the frontend
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

### Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for production deployment
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with replication for high availability
- **Redis**: Caching layer and session management

- **40% Improvement** in resource utilization
- **50% Faster** invoice generation
- **99.9% Uptime** SLA achieved
- **15+ Enterprise Clients** onboarded in first year

## Lessons Learned

1. **Architecture Matters**: The upfront investment in Hexagonal Architecture paid dividends in maintainability
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript end-to-end eliminated entire classes of bugs
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite enabled confident refactoring
4. **Documentation**: Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) proved invaluable for team alignment
5. **Incremental Migration**: Phased approach to CQRS implementation reduced risk
