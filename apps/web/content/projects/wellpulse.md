## Technical Architecture

### Database-Agnostic Design

One of the unique aspects of WellPulse is its database-agnostic architecture:

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary production database
- **SQLite**: Embedded database for mobile offline storage
- **MongoDB**: Document storage for certain use cases
- **Abstraction Layer**: Repository pattern isolates database implementation
- **Easy Migration**: Can switch databases with minimal code changes

### Data Synchronization

The synchronization engine is the heart of the platform:

```typescript
// Simplified sync flow
1. Mobile app queues changes locally (SQLite)
2. When online, changes uploaded to API
3. Sync engine processes changes
4. Conflicts detected and resolved
5. Updates pushed to other clients
6. Local changes merged with server state
```

### Multi-Platform Data Model

Shared TypeScript types across all platforms ensure consistency:

- **Shared Types**: Single source of truth for data structures
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime validation
- **Code Generation**: Prisma + Drizzle for type-safe queries
- **GraphQL**: Type-safe API contracts

## Technology Stack

## Development Challenges

### Offline Synchronization
The biggest technical challenge was ensuring data integrity across offline/online transitions:

- **Solution**: Implemented event sourcing for critical data
- **Conflict Resolution**: Operational Transformation (OT) for certain fields
- **Last-Write-Wins**: For non-critical data with timestamp authority
- **Manual Resolution**: UI for complex conflicts requiring human decision

### Cross-Platform Consistency
Maintaining feature parity across web and mobile:

- **Shared Business Logic**: Extracted to shared packages
- **Component Libraries**: Separate UI, shared behavior
- **Testing**: Cross-platform integration tests
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout to different platforms

### Performance with Large Datasets
Field operations generate massive amounts of data:

- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for efficient loading
- **Lazy Loading**: On-demand data fetching
- **Data Pruning**: Automatic cleanup of old offline data
- **Optimistic Updates**: Instant UI feedback
- **Background Sync**: Non-blocking synchronization

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: SQLite encryption on mobile
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communication
- **Secure Storage**: Keychain (iOS) and Keystore (Android)
- **Data Isolation**: Per-tenant data segregation

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT**: Stateless authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions
- **Offline Access**: Cached permissions
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic renewal
- **Biometric**: Fingerprint/Face ID support

## Business Impact

- **70% Reduction** in data entry time
- **90% Decrease** in data entry errors
- **Real-Time Visibility** into field operations
- **40% Improvement** in compliance adherence
- **Enhanced Safety** through digital checklists
